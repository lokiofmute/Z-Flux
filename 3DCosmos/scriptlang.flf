This object type encapsulates a point in three-dimensional space.

The software makes a distinction between points and vectors (see \linkitem{T:Vector}). A point is a unique position in the three-dimensional space, whereas a vector indicates a direction with a magnitude. A vector can be thought of as a line with a direction, connecting two points in the space. After the choice of an origin and a basis, both entities can be represented three coordinates $X$, $Y$ and $Z$, but they reflect different properties of the space.

For example, they behave differently under an affine transformation (see \linkitem{T:Transformation}). A translation affects points, but leaves vectors unchanged.

A SolidShape object defines a three-dimensional shape, that can be used for rendering in a scene through the object type \linkitem{T:SolidObject}.

SolidShape objects can be created through a number of functions that create a variety of different shapes. In addition, warping functions can be used to morph the shape of a SolidShape object.

Further on, powerful Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) tools to create more complex shapes by combining shapes in a number of different ways, using addition, subtraction and multiplication operators.

Each face of a shape can have a specific label ID, represented by a scalar number. This label can be used to paint the different faces of a shape in a different color (see \linkitem{F:SolidObject:SetColor}).
