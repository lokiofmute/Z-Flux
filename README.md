Z-Flux is a freeware software program for real-time, interactive rendering of digital animations in stereo.

* *Free!* You can download and use Z-Flux free of charge.

* *Real-time.* All renderings are performed real-time, typically at 60 frames per second.

* *Interactive.* The user can control key aspects of an animation while it is running.
    This includes control over space and time, but also much more. For example, in the satellite orbit simulator the user can instantly change orbit parameters and see the result.

* *Stereo.* Z-Flux can render in stereo, which means that, for each time frame, two images are created for
    the left and right eye. Using proper equipment, this means that it can visualise these renderings in true,
    immersive 3D.

* *Flexible.* The engine of Z-Flux is a powerful script language, FluxScript.
    Everything in the software, including the start screen and all animations, is actually a script.
    This results in an unparalleled flexibility to adapt the software to specific situations.

* *Extensible.* Using FluxScript, advanced users can develop their own scripts to create new stereo animations.

**Scope**
The program was developed as an educational tool to help the understanding of advanced concepts in astronomy:
the solar system, celestial dynamics and space exploration.
Later, it has been extended to areas such as physics, mathematics, chemistry and geology.
It is available free of charge, in the hope that it will help people to better understand some fascinating
topics in these areas.
Z-Flux also contains a fancy stereo foto browser and a powerful tool to create stereo slide shows.

**System requirements**
Z-Flux runs on Windows XP, Windows Vista and Window 7 and uses OpenGL rendering.
Stereo rendering requires a fast graphics card with dual screen output.
Typically, a modern medium to high end graphics card for gamers will give excellent results.
